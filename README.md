# V-Checker
Used to check files or URLs from an unknown origin while protecting the user's safety. 

This page is intended for users to understand what exactly V-Checker does and how it works. 

V-Checker is a tool designed by me to check for malicious content in files or URLs without using a web browser to do so. It is intended to save time and protect the user's security with regards to clicking on files/URLs from an unknown origin which is usually unsafe.  

V-Checker relies on the VirusTotal API in which more details is available here (https://developers.virustotal.com/v2.0/reference/getting-started). 

V-Checker allows one to check up to 4 different URLs or files in one minute due to VirusTotal API's restrictions.
